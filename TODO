This is where I theorize about what I may be doing with UT in the future.

20131225 - Yes, thinking about stuff on Christmas.  I'm beginning to wonder if
a large number of tree sources might result in slow render times for UT.  To
avoid this, I'm thinking of setting up an optional "master/slave" setup, where:

- The master pulls the trees from all the slaves on a regular basis - say, once
  an hour, and stores the built tree in a DB table or set of tables.
- The slaves manage their own tables as normal, but instead of every individual
  Cacti install building the Unified Trees on their own, they would request the
  tree the master built.
- This would simplify setup greatly; only the master would need access to all
  slaves; the slaves would only need to access the master's database.  Since
  the slaves only pull the full tree from one source, render times should be
  minimal.

Downside?  Something added to a Cacti install since the last time the master
built the tree will not show up on the table.

Alternative?  Possibly some way for the slaves to submit changes to the master.
