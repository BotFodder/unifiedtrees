    Version ........ 0.8
    Purpose ........ Pull Tree information from other Cacti installs

*******************************************************************************/

----[ Purpose

    This plugin connects to the databases of other Cacti installs for tree
graph information to unify them into one tree for display and navigation
between Cacti instances.

----[ Features

	Options include allowing unifiedtrees to disable database connections
that fail to connect.  If a database is down for some reason, continually
attempting to connect to it can cause slow response from a web browser as the
code tries to build the unified tree.  Disabled connections must be manually
reenabled.

----[ Installation

	If you have not already done so, install the Plugin Architecture
	http://cactiusers.org/wiki/PluginArchitectureInstall

	Next install this Plugin using these directions
	http://cactiusers.org/wiki/PluginsInstall

	Provide each Cacti install SELECT access to the MySQL databases for
every other install.

----[ Warnings

 - Currently, the install process requires patching the file lib/html_tree.php
	for UT to work.  There's a lot that can cause this process to fail.
	As such, support for using a Cacti other than version 0.8.8b downloaded
	from the "Linux/Unix in tar.gz format" link on the Cacti Downloads page
	is extremely limited (read: "mostly not supported").  Submitting Issues
	or requests for assitance for a version of Cacti obtained any other way
	will not be a priority and the author reserves the right to tell you
	"Too bad, I can't help you."

 - If you've downloaded the "Windows ZIP" version of the code, the patch
 	process will fail.  You must use the "Linux/Unix tar.gz" version, or
 	convert lib/html_tree.php from "dos" to "unix" version prior to
 	patching.
 
 - Repository provided versions of Cacti, even if they are advertised as
 	being version 0.8.8b, are unsupported.  As an example, the
 	lib/html_tree.php provided by EPEL's Cacti package is significantly
 	different from the Cacti source provided version, and patching the
 	EPEL version will not fully succeed.

----[ Changelog
    --- 0.8 ---
    I ran into a situation where some hosts were homed on the wrong Cacti
    host, but I also wanted to come up with a way to maintain the old data on
    the original host.  UT now checks if a host is "disabled" when building
    the tree and appends a " (D)" to the hostname.  This avoids disabled
    hosts colliding with active ones, but note:
    - This still means you can't have more than one active host or the names
      will collide and your master tree will only show one of them;
    - This also means that you can have only one disabled host as well, and
      having more than one will result in collisions.
    - Your alternative? Change the hostname of disabled hosts manually.
      Sorry, I have no other alternatives.
    - Other alternative?  Move disabled hosts to a different leaf.

    I needed more frequent building of the tree.

    --- 0.7 ---
    Minor new feature triggered by a development site need: "Other" tree.
    Set the name of a tree you want to show up at the very end of the list of
    trees.

    --- 0.6 ---
    While there is no new options or features, the fact that this bugfix
    resolves a major operability issue rates moving to 0.6 (as opposed to
    0.51).
    - A bug exists in all previous versions involving collisions of what is
      supposed to be a unique ID within the tree structure.  There's more
      information on the blog post linked above.
    - To fully resolve the issue the patch for html_tree.php has expanded a
      bit.

    --- 0.5 ---
    Skipping some version values as functionality has expanded greatly.
    - You can now institute a "server/clients" setup (multiple servers
      possible).
      - Server: runs a poller task that will build a tree at a specified
        interval and save the tree in a special memory based table.  When it
        needs to render that tree, it pulls the tree out of it's own table and
        displays it.
      - Client: connects to first enabled/responding/has tree table entry in
        its "tree sources" list, pulls the tree out of the memory based table
        on that server, and displays it.
      - "Always": Unified Trees operates as it did in 0.1 - pulling trees from
        all servers in its "tree sources" list (every time a tree would be
        loaded) and displays it.
    - Configured as a client with multiple enabled servers, but with "disable
      bad servers" active, a client will disable a server that does not have
      the ut_tree table (or does not respond at all) and will no longer try to
      pull the tree from that server.
    - "Fatal Failures" at any point should simply result in the local tree
      being displayed as it normally would.
