    Version ........ 0.71
    Purpose ........ Pull Tree information from other Cacti installs

*******************************************************************************/

----[ Purpose

    This plugin connects to the databases of other Cacti installs for tree
graph information to unify them into one tree for display and navigation
between Cacti instances.

----[ Features

	Options include allowing unifiedtrees to disable database connections
that fail to connect.  If a database is down for some reason, continually
attempting to connect to it can cause slow response from a web browser as the
code tries to build the unified tree.  Disabled connections must be manually
reenabled.

----[ Installation

	If you have not already done so, install the Plugin Architecture
	http://cactiusers.org/wiki/PluginArchitectureInstall

	Next install this Plugin using these directions
	http://cactiusers.org/wiki/PluginsInstall

	Provide each Cacti install SELECT access to the MySQL databases for
every other install.

----[ Changelog

    --- 0.71 ---
    I needed more frequent building of the tree.

    --- 0.7 ---
    Minor new feature triggered by a development site need: "Other" tree.
    Set the name of a tree you want to show up at the very end of the list of
    trees.

    --- 0.6 ---
    While there is no new options or features, the fact that this bugfix
    resolves a major operability issue rates moving to 0.6 (as opposed to
    0.51).
    - A bug exists in all previous versions involving collisions of what is
      supposed to be a unique ID within the tree structure.  There's more
      information on the blog post linked above.
    - To fully resolve the issue the patch for html_tree.php has expanded a
      bit.

    --- 0.5 ---
    Skipping some version values as functionality has expanded greatly.
    - You can now institute a "server/clients" setup (multiple servers
      possible).
      - Server: runs a poller task that will build a tree at a specified
        interval and save the tree in a special memory based table.  When it
        needs to render that tree, it pulls the tree out of it's own table and
        displays it.
      - Client: connects to first enabled/responding/has tree table entry in
        its "tree sources" list, pulls the tree out of the memory based table
        on that server, and displays it.
      - "Always": Unified Trees operates as it did in 0.1 - pulling trees from
        all servers in its "tree sources" list (every time a tree would be
        loaded) and displays it.
    - Configured as a client with multiple enabled servers, but with "disable
      bad servers" active, a client will disable a server that does not have
      the ut_tree table (or does not respond at all) and will no longer try to
      pull the tree from that server.
    - "Fatal Failures" at any point should simply result in the local tree
      being displayed as it normally would.

    --- 0.1 ---
    Initial release.
