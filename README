    Version ........ 0.1
    Purpose ........ Pull Tree information from other Cacti installs

*******************************************************************************/

----[ Purpose

    This plugin connects to the databases of other Cacti installs for tree
graph information to unify them into one tree for display and navigation
between Cacti instances.

----[ Features

	Options include allowing unifiedtrees to disable database connections
that fail to connect.  If a database is down for some reason, continually
attempting to connect to it can cause slow response from a web browser as the
code tries to build the unified tree.  Disabled connections must be manually
reenabled.

----[ Installation

	If you have not already done so, install the Plugin Architecture
	http://cactiusers.org/wiki/PluginArchitectureInstall

	Next install this Plugin using these directions
	http://cactiusers.org/wiki/PluginsInstall

	Provide each Cacti install SELECT access to the MySQL databases for
every other install.
